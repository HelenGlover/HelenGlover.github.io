    <blockquote>
        Part of realizing our potential is recognizing how our particular gifts and limitations fit with the world around us. We realize where our authentic potential actually lies. Page 53

    <blockquote>
       Shoulds can masquerade as high standards or lofty goals, but they are not the same. Goals direct us from the inside but shoulds judge us from the outside. Goals feel like authentic dreams, while shoulds feel like oppressive standards. Shoulds set up a false dichotomy between either meeting an ideal or being a failure, between perfection or settling. The tyranny of the should even pits us against our own best interests. Page 54

       Every problem was once a solution. Page 103
